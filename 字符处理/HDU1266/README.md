Welcome to 2006'4 computer college programming contest! 

Specially, I give my best regards to all freshmen! You are the future of HDU ACM! And now, I must tell you that ACM problems are always not so easy, but, except this one... Ha-Ha! 

Give you an integer; your task is to output its reverse number. Here, reverse number is defined as follows: 
1. The reverse number of a positive integer ending without 0 is general reverse, for example, reverse (12) = 21; 
2. The reverse number of a negative integer is negative, for example, reverse (-12) = -21; 
3. The reverse number of an integer ending with 0 is described as example, reverse (1200) = 2100.
